# Modern-graphic-engine-based-only-on-mixed-algorithms

I'm excited to announce that I'm preparing a modern graphic engine based on mixed algorithms rather than using several textures. In the futur,
it's up to you to mix all those things inherited from my stuff. Recently, with my own fighting video game and supercomputer chess engine, I don't have time.
Hum, I can take my time if I don't play chess too much and give you the first steps. I don't know if my supercomputer chess engine can be used to create a highly parallel
library to plug into the GPU. Oh, sorry ! I mean if I have time, I will start this thing too because I'm not alone !
